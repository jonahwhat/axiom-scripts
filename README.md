# Script Brushes for Axiom
https://axiom.moulberry.com/

## Adding Scripts to Axiom
1. Locate your script brush folder. This is what the path is for me: `C:\Users\your_name\AppData\Roaming\.minecraftAxiom\config\axiom\tool_presets\script_brush`
2. Copy the lua files of your choice into this folder

## Using Scripts
1. Open Editor Mode in Axiom
2. Select the "Script Brush" in the tools tab
3. Look through the script presets and select your desired brush
4. Use it like a normal axiom tool!
