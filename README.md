# Scripts for Axiom!
## Adding Scripts to Axiom
1. Locate your script brush folder. This is what the path is for me: `C:\Users\your_name\AppData\Roaming\.minecraftAxiom\config\axiom\tool_presets\script_brush`
2. Copy the lua files of your choice into this folder

## Using Scripts
1. Open Editor Mode in Axiom
2. Select the Script Brush
3. Look through the presets and select your desired brush
4. Right click in the world to use!
